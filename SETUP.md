# Setup Guide for Your GSoC Dashboard

Welcome to your GSoC Dashboard! This guide will walk you through setting up your personalized dashboard in just a few minutes.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Participation in Google Summer of Code (or any open-source program)
- A web browser

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Fork This Repository

1. Click the **Fork** button at the top right of the [repository page](https://github.com/OWASP-BLT/MY-GSOC-TOOL)
2. Wait for GitHub to create your fork
3. You now have your own copy at `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/MY-GSOC-TOOL`

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages will host your dashboard for free:

1. Go to your forked repository
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon in the top menu)
3. Scroll down and click **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** from the dropdown
5. Click **Save**

Your dashboard will be available at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/MY-GSOC-TOOL/`

### 3. Configure Your Personal Information

#### Edit `config.json`

This is the main configuration file for your dashboard. Click on `config.json` in your repository and then click the pencil icon to edit.

Replace the placeholder values with your information:

```json
{
  "student": {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "bio": "GSoC 2024 @ OWASP | Full-Stack Developer",
    "avatar": "https://github.com/janedoe.png",
    "github": "https://github.com/janedoe",
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
    "blog": "https://janedoe.dev",
    "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/janedoe"
  },
  "project": {
    "title": "BLT - Bug Logging Tool Enhancement",
    "description": "Improving the bug reporting and management system with new features including advanced search, real-time notifications, and an improved UI.",
    "organization": "OWASP Foundation",
    "timeline": "May 2024 - August 2024",
    "repository": "https://github.com/OWASP-BLT/BLT"
  },
  "slack": {
    "workspaceUrl": "https://owasp.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-xyz",
    "channels": [
      "general",
      "gsoc-2024",
      "blt-project"
    ]
  },
  "mentor": {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@owasp.org",
    "avatar": "https://github.com/johnsmith.png",
    "role": "OWASP BLT Maintainer & GSoC Mentor",
    "github": "https://github.com/johnsmith"
  }
}
```

**Tips:**
- For `avatar`, use `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME.png` to automatically use your GitHub profile picture
- Leave any field empty (use `""`) if you don't want to display it
- The `repository` should point to the main project you're contributing to

#### Commit Your Changes

After editing, scroll down and click **Commit changes**.

### 4. Add Your Content

#### Blog Posts (`data/blog-posts.json`)

Add your GSoC blog posts:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "GSoC 2024: My Journey Begins",
    "excerpt": "Excited to share that I've been selected for GSoC 2024! Here's what I'll be working on.",
    "url": "https://janedoe.dev/gsoc-2024-begins",
    "date": "2024-05-01",
    "readTime": "5 min read"
  },
  {
    "title": "First Week: Understanding the Codebase",
    "excerpt": "My first week involved diving deep into the existing codebase and understanding the architecture.",

    "summary": "Set up development environment, reviewed project requirements with mentor, created initial project timeline and milestones.",
    "date": "2024-06-03"
  },

### 5. Automatic GitHub Contributions

The dashboard automatically fetches your GitHub activity! The workflow:

1. Runs daily at midnight UTC
2. Fetches your commits, pull requests, issues, and reviews
3. Updates `data/github-contributions.json`
4. Deploys the updated dashboard to GitHub Pages

**Manual Update:**
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click **Update GSoC Dashboard**
3. Click **Run workflow** → **Run workflow**

### 6. View Your Dashboard

After setup, your dashboard will be live at:

```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/MY-GSOC-TOOL/
```

Give it a few minutes for the initial deployment to complete.

### 7. Running Locally 
You can also run the dashboard updates from your local machine:

1.  **Install Node.js**: Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/); no other dependencies (like `npm install`) are required.
2.  **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    node scripts/fetch-github-data.js
    ```
    This fetches your latest data and updates `data/github-contributions.json`.
3.  **Authentication**:
    - By default, the script runs unauthenticated (limit: 60 requests/hour).
    - To increase limits, create a `.env` file with your token: `GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token`.

## 🎨 Customization Tips

### Change Colors

Edit `styles.css` and modify the CSS variables:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #4285f4;    /* Main brand color */
    --secondary-color: #34a853;   /* Secondary brand color */
    --accent-color: #fbbc04;      /* Accent/highlight color */
    --danger-color: #ea4335;      /* Error/danger color */
}
```

### Add Custom Sections

Edit `index.html` to add your own sections following the existing card pattern:

```html
<section class="card">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-your-icon"></i> Your Section Title</h2>
    <div id="your-content">
        <!-- Your content here -->
    </div>
</section>
```

### Modify Layout

The dashboard uses CSS Grid. Edit the grid in `styles.css`:

```css
.content-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(500px, 1fr));
    gap: 30px;
}
```

## 📱 Sharing Your Dashboard

Once your dashboard is live, share it:

1. **In Your GSoC Proposal** - Link to your dashboard to showcase your preparation
2. **In Your Final Report** - Document your entire journey
3. **On Social Media** - Share your progress with the community
4. **In Your Resume** - Demonstrate your GSoC experience
5. **With Your Organization** - Keep everyone updated on your progress

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Showing

**Problem:** The page shows a 404 error.

**Solution:**
1. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled (Settings → Pages)
2. Verify the source is set to "GitHub Actions"
3. Check the Actions tab to see if the workflow ran successfully

### GitHub Contributions Not Updating

**Problem:** The contributions section shows zeros or old data.

**Solution:**
1. Go to Actions tab and manually trigger the workflow
2. Check if the workflow has proper permissions
3. Verify your GitHub username in `config.json` is correct
4. Make sure your contributions are public (not in private repos)

### Invalid JSON Errors

**Problem:** Dashboard shows errors or doesn't load.

**Solution:**
1. Validate your JSON files at [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com)
2. Common issues:
   - Missing commas between items
   - Extra comma after the last item
   - Unescaped quotes in strings
   - Missing closing brackets

### Styling Issues

**Problem:** The page looks broken or unstyled.

**Solution:**
1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check the browser console for errors (F12)
3. Verify all files are committed and pushed

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Update Regularly:** Commit your progress weekly to keep the dashboard current
2. **Write Meaningful Updates:** Provide context in your weekly summaries
3. **Document Challenges:** Share not just successes, but also challenges you overcame
4. **Get Mentor Feedback:** Regularly ask for and document mentor feedback
